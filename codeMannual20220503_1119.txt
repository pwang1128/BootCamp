Assumption to be addressed: 
1. NFT is represented as a string
2. time horizon is negligible

Problem 1 : admission
-> set up the addmissionFee
-> receive ether: check EOA, check enough fee, else fallback
-> fallback: ether
-> impose the reentrancy lock
-> collect the string NFT
-> record the address and NFT info in mapping
-> record the info in the NFT mapping
-> 1 weeks

Problem 2: View NFT
-> Display all strings of NFT
Problem 3: Offer prices and buy NFT
-> view the latest offered prices
-> parti can offer prices to buy the NFT
-> owner of the NFT can select and confirm the highest value buyer
-> act as intermediary for NFT tx
-> update info in mappings
-> 1.5 weeks

Problem 4: Voting
-> Choose the 2 NFT among all of them. 
-> 0.5 week

Problem 5: Distribute reward to owners
-> Calculate total no of votes
-> Select the winning NFT and pay the reward to the owner
-> pay the profit to me
